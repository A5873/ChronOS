# ChronOS - A Minimalist Task Scheduler

ChronOS is an educational implementation of a priority-based task scheduler, designed to demonstrate the core concepts of operating system process scheduling in a simplified, understandable format.

## üîç Overview

ChronOS provides a lightweight, user-space implementation of task scheduling concepts typically found in operating system kernels. It serves as a learning tool for understanding how processes are managed, scheduled, and executed in modern operating systems.

Rather than attempting to implement a full-featured kernel scheduler, ChronOS focuses on clarity and educational value, making the fundamental concepts of scheduling accessible to students and enthusiasts interested in operating system design.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Priority-based scheduling**: Tasks with higher priority are executed first
- **Fair scheduling**: Tasks of equal priority get fair execution time
- **Cooperative multitasking**: Tasks can yield CPU time to other tasks
- **Task sleeping**: Tasks can sleep for specified time periods
- **Dynamic task creation**: Create and add tasks at runtime
- **Resource management**: Proper cleanup of task resources
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-understand interface for task manipulation

## üì¶ Building ChronOS

### Prerequisites

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make
- Standard C library

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the debug version with all logging enabled
make debug

# Build the release version with optimizations
make release

# Run the test suite
make run_test_debug

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Task Creation

```c
#include "minisched.h"

void my_task_function(void* arg) {
    printf("Task running with argument: %s\n", (char*)arg);
    // Task code here
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the scheduler
    scheduler_init();
    
    // Create a task with priority level 2
    task_t* task = create_task(my_task_function, PRIORITY_MEDIUM, 
                             "Hello ChronOS", "MyTask");
    
    // Add the task to the scheduler
    scheduler_add_task(task);
    
    // Run the scheduler
    scheduler_run();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Task Yielding and Sleeping

```c
void cooperative_task(void* arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Task %s, iteration %d\n", (char*)arg, i);
        
        // Yield to allow other tasks to run
        task_yield();
    }
}

void sleeping_task(void* arg) {
    printf("Task %s going to sleep\n", (char*)arg);
    
    // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
    task_sleep_ms(500);
    
    printf("Task %s woke up\n", (char*)arg);
}
```

### Shutting Down the Scheduler

```c
void cleanup_task(void* arg) {
    // Do some work
    
    // Then shut down the scheduler
    scheduler_shutdown();
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

ChronOS currently implements fundamental scheduling concepts, but there are many exciting possibilities for future enhancements:

1. **True preemptive multitasking**: Implement true context switching with register saving/restoring
2. **Multi-core support**: Allow tasks to run on different CPU cores
3. **More scheduling algorithms**: Implement additional algorithms like CFS, EDF, etc.
4. **Inter-task communication**: Add message passing or shared memory primitives
5. **Task synchronization**: Implement mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables
6. **Real-time scheduling**: Add support for real-time constraints and deadlines
7. **Dynamic priority adjustment**: Allow task priorities to change based on behavior
8. **Task groups**: Implement task grouping and hierarchical scheduling
9. **Resource accounting**: Track CPU usage and other resources per task
10. **Plugin system**: Allow for custom scheduling policies to be plugged in

# MiniSched: A Minimalist Process Scheduler

## Project Overview

MiniSched is an educational implementation of a simple process scheduler designed to demonstrate fundamental operating system concepts. It provides a clear, concise codebase that illustrates how task scheduling works in modern operating systems, without the complexity found in production schedulers.

### Educational Purpose

This project serves several educational purposes:

- **Demonstrate Scheduling Concepts**: Illustrates fundamental scheduling algorithms and techniques
- **Show Task Management**: Provides a practical example of task creation, execution, and cleanup
- **Explain Context Switching**: Demonstrates simplified task context switching
- **Illustrate Cooperative Multitasking**: Shows how tasks can voluntarily yield control
- **Present Resource Management**: Demonstrates memory allocation and cleanup for tasks

## Architecture and Design

MiniSched implements a simplified round-robin scheduler with the following core components:

### Core Components

1. **Task Structure**: Represents a schedulable unit of work with metadata
2. **Ready Queue**: Maintains a linked list of tasks ready for execution
3. **Scheduler Loop**: Main execution engine that selects and runs tasks
4. **Context Switching**: Simplified mechanism to switch between tasks
5. **Task Synchronization**: Methods for tasks to yield control or sleep

### Design Decisions

- **Simplified Context**: Uses function calls rather than actual register/stack manipulation
- **Cooperative Scheduling**: Primarily relies on tasks to yield control
- **Round-Robin Algorithm**: Each task gets a time slice before moving to the next
- **Task States**: Implements READY, RUNNING, SLEEPING, BLOCKED, and FINISHED states
- **Memory Management**: Handles stack allocation and cleanup for tasks

## Implementation Details

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Tasks are created with `create_task()`, allocating memory and initializing state
2. **Scheduling**: Tasks are added to the ready queue with `scheduler_add_task()`
3. **Execution**: The scheduler selects tasks to run based on their state and priority
4. **Yielding**: Tasks can yield control with `task_yield()` or sleep with `task_sleep_ms()`
5. **Completion**: Tasks mark themselves as FINISHED when their function returns
6. **Cleanup**: The scheduler removes finished tasks and frees their resources

### Key Features

#### Task Trampoline

The task trampoline function serves as a wrapper around task functions, handling their completion:

```c
static void task_trampoline(struct task* task) {
    /* Execute the task function */
    task->function(task->arg);
    
    /* Task has completed, mark it as finished */
    task->status = TASK_FINISHED;
    
    /* Return to let scheduler handle cleanup */
}
```

#### Context Switching

A simplified context switch that selects the next task to run:

```c
static void context_switch(task_t* next) {
    /* Update current task if it exists */
    if (g_scheduler.current) {
        /* Handle current task based on its status */
        ...
    }
    
    /* Update and run the next task */
    g_scheduler.current = next;
    next->status = TASK_RUNNING;
    
    /* Execute the task */
    if (next->status == TASK_RUNNING) {
        task_trampoline(next);
    }
}
```

#### Task Removal

When tasks finish, they're removed from the queue and their resources are freed:

```c
static bool remove_task_from_queue(task_t* task) {
    /* Remove task from linked list */
    ...
    
    /* Free resources */
    if (task->context.stack_pointer) {
        free(task->context.stack_pointer);
    }
    
    /* Free the task itself */
    free(task);
    
    return true;
}
```
